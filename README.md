### Hi 👋
I am recent engineering graduate looking for opportunities and collabaration in projects related to data science and deep learning.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on image classification (also, I am brushing up my data structures and algorithms skills regularly).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques using PyTorch.
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on data science and deep learning projects.
